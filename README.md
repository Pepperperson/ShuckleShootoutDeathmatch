# Shuckle Shootout Deathmatch
This is an edit of a game my buddy made for my birthday a couple years back, focused on bringing a fun (yet still hardcore) Quake/Unreal-styled deathmatch experience.

## Features
- Shuckle!
- Hand-drawn MS Paint-y sprites
- Simple movement, just jump while moving forward.
- Many weapons, such as the Thunder Rifle, Killpill, & Mounted Miniguns
- Easy to host using services such as [The Sentinel's Playground](https://allfearthesentinel.com/) & [Euroboros](https://euroboros.net/)
- Easily editable, if you know how to do Zandronum-level ZDoom stuff, you can mod this.

## Utilized projects
- [Q-Zandronum](https://github.com/IgeNiaI/Q-Zandronum), the engine this runs on.
